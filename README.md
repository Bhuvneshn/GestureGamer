# How To Play This Game?
1. Ensure you have a device with good system requirements so as to play the game smoothly.
2. Download the repository code through the ZIP file
3. Ensure you have Python and CMake (for opencv) installed (bhuv change this line to how you were able to play the game)
4. Install all the packages of Python using the commmand `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the flask app using the command `python3 app.py` or `python app.py` according to the Python version installed on your computer
6. Allow the app to access your webcam
7. MOST IMPORTANT STEP: Enjoy the game!

# Inspiration
The Pygames competition placed a special emphasis on retro aspect of the game, so we decided to do something around this theme. We brainstormed for ideas and came up with the concept of building a modern version of Mario. To add a unique twist, we decided to incorporate computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand gestures and allow players to control the game without touching the keyboard.

# What it does
Our project enables users to play Mario using hand gestures captured through their webcam.

# How we built it
We explored different approaches during the duration of the hackathon, even facing setbacks such as losing all our files and having to start from scratch. Our timeline can be summarized as follows:

1.Brainstormed and finalized the idea of building a modern Mario game with hand gesture controls.
2.Initially attempted to build custom machine learning models using thousands of images, but realized it was not optimized and changed our approach.
3.Shifted focus to frontend development using the Kaboom.JS library for building browser games.
4.Explored the Mediapipe package by Google in Python for hand gesture recognition and integrated it as the backend in Flask framework.
5.Overcame challenges such as lack of documentation and unfamiliarity with new libraries.
6.Completed the project, including project description and pitch, with limited time remaining for submission.

# Challenges we ran into
We encountered various challenges throughout the hackathon, including sleep deprivation, lack of knowledge in Flask backend development, and working with new libraries for the first time.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have successfully completed a project that we initially thought might be too complex. We also feel accomplished for building a project in line with the retro considerations of the Pygames Hackathon.

# What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in using new libraries, building browser games with Python and JavaScript, and overcoming challenges in a time-constrained hackathon environment.
